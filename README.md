# CIComputeR WEB

## Introduction
`CIcomputeR WEB` is a Shiny application which aims to compute two-combination drug synergy using the Chou-Talalay Combination Index (CI). The theoretical basis behind CI computation can be found across various literature, such as [1,2]. In brief, the value of CI can explain whether the combination of two drug treatments shows synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects by fitting a linear model with respect to treatment group population. 
The program can be accessed here: https://brianjmpark.shinyapps.io/cicomputer/

## Companion R package
`CIcomputer WEB`'s functionalities can be streamlined using the R package `CIcomputeR`, which can be found here: https://rdrr.io/github/snowoflondon/CIcomputeR/. 

## Run-through
The application takes a tabular data containing the two drug concentrations and cell response measurements (typically obtained from a cell viability assay, such as the MTT) as input. The required column headers are as follows:

* `Conc1` = concentration for the one of the drugs.
* `Conc2` = concentration for the other drug.
* `Response` = viability **or** inhibition values in decimals (i.e., <= 1) or in percentages (i.e., <= 100). 

After file input, the user selects whether the values under the column `Response` corresponds to viability or inhibition values and checks the box which indicates whether these values are in decimals or percentages. 

Executing the program generates a table containing the effect size and the calculated CI.
